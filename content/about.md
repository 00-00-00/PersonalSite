Arjun here. I am very interested in observing and building systems, be it software systems or a motorcycle engine. Spinning a spanner is one of the most satisfactory feelings, so is when modules interact seamlessly with each other.
I've mostly worked on Android codebases. I am learning about design patterns for software architecture, Restful APIs, databases and website development.

I like really long cross country motorcycle tours. They say that one who travels is the one who learns the most. And for me, a motorcycle is one of the best way to experience travel. You are vulnerable and exposed to the elements, yet so undoubtedly free. Unlike a tour of a few kilometers, an adventure of weeks long changes you with every passing mile. You discover something deeper within yourself, as if you've travelled your mind as you've travelled the landscape. The constant meditation and self introspection sometimes gives you more questions than answers yet it is said the road has all the answers.
