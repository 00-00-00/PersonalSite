## The mountains are calling

The moment I completed the Bhutan trip, I knew Leh was the next destination. After a failed previous attempt to make it the holy lands of an Indian motorcyclist, I was loosely aware of the destination that I wanted to reach. This time around I knew going in that I am going to be attempting this journey alone, so if it fails it's all on me. It also meant that I had to pull all the weight of coming up with the entire plan, despite being terrible at planning anything. On the brighter side, since it's just me, and I am not a person who likes everything to be mapped out to the last detail, I didn't have anybody to convince. I was not going to attempt Leh during the months of June or July for sure, the months were the traffic of tourists are going to be guarenteed to be the highest. The snow that covered the mountain passes would have started to melt away, the roads would have been just opened. Leh, with no doubt, must be looking at it's best during these months. Yet, the factor that decided the question of when was quite simply: *How do you want to experience it?*. Recollections of a few popular attractions rushes to mind; noisy, congested. Cars, taxis and selfies are everywhere, people who are sometimes quite simply there. I see that they reached here, they have seen here, but are they experiencing here?

In contrast, a picture of a motorcycle leaving a trail of dust behind him running along with wild horses, with the backdrop of terribly large mountains, capped with snow, a man on the motorcycle, with a grin that spreads from ear to ear. If it is freedom that you want to experience, then Leh was waiting, you just have to wait as well, just a bit. I decided to pick the last comfortable time to reach Leh, enough lee-way so that the roads stay open and I don't get snowed in. Late enough so that the roads are empty. The end of August seemed like the right time.

As the days to the end of August got numbered, it was time to come up with the route map. After reading about the routes of travellers before me, I had decided that I'll be travelling to Leh from Srinagar throught the NH1, and return via the Leh-Manali highway. This route presented itself with multiple benefits. First one being that it is the best road to Leh, The passes between Srinagar and Leh are mostly unintimidating and gradual. This would mean a good stretch to acclimitised to the mountains. Acute Mountain Sickness, resulting from the body unable to function normally because of the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere in the high mountains, is something I would avoid, especially because I would be travelling alone and on a tight schedule. Second one was that the road from Manali to Leh is the road of dreams, yet is not known to be an easy road. It's treacherously narrow at places, with river crossings, landslides, falling rocks, slushes, sand and other demons that made it their homes. If I did NH1 first and if I found that to be a simple task, then I could step up and take my chance at the Manali - Leh road.
